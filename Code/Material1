I have researched some applications that can be used for building a 3d model here are findings
1)We can use agisoft for mapping the images and here is the video link of how it is done.

2)we can use OpenDroneMap that is an alternativ which can be used for mapping the images and building a 3-d model.
here is the video link of how it is done:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmlInulErJI
and here is the doocumentation of open drone map
https://docs.opendronemap.org/installation/
It also contains the installation of it
Open drone Map is in development phase and I think it is providing more features compared to Agisoft and is more user friendly
